## Frameworks & Tooling üß∞

In order to complete the the lessons you need to install the following:

|Prerequisite|Description

## Creating your local workspace üë©‚Äçüíª

We strongly suggest you create a new folder (local git repository) and use this repository for reference only (for when you're stuck).

- Create a new folder to work in:

    ```cmd
    C:\dev\mkdir functionsworkshop
    C:\dev\cd .\functionsworkshop\
    ```

- Turn this into a git repository:

    ```cmd
    C:\dev\functionsworkshop\git init
    ```

- Add subfolders for the source code and test files:

    ```cmd
    C:\dev\functionsworkshop\mkdir src
    C:\dev\functionsworkshop\mkdir tst
    ```

You should be good to go now!
